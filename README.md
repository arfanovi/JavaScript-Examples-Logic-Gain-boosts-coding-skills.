i. Write a program that takes three arguments prob, prize, pay and returns true if prob * prize > pay; otherwise return false.


    Input:::
    The input consists of one float 
    F and two integer 𝑁, N, numbers.
    Output:::
    The output will print either "true" or "false"

ii. Write a program that returns the number of frames shown in a given number of minutes for a certain FPS. FPS stands for "frames per second" and it's the number of frames a computer screen shows every second.


    Input:::
    The input consists of two integer number: minute and fps.
    Output:::
    The output will print an integers.





iii. Write a program that will calculate Kinetic Energy. It can be calculated with the following formula: KE = 0.5mV*V where m is mass in kg, v is velocity in m/s, KE is kinetic energy in J. Return the Kinetic Energy in Joules, given the mass and velocity. For the purposes of this challenge, round answers to the nearest integer.


    Input:::
    The input consists of two double number: mass and velocity.
    Output:::
    The output will print an integer.
